  <h2>ACT: SWEET MIRAGE</h2>
  <p>ACT: SWEET MIRAGE is Tomorrow X Together's Second World Tour centering around their latest album <em>The Name Chapter: Temptation</em>. The group performed 25 songs including an unreleased song, <em>Blue Spring</em>. I attended DAY 1 of ACT: SWEET MIRAGE in LA on May 27, 2023. The sold-out concert at was BMO Stadium in LA which has a capacity of 22,000 people, more than 3x the capacity of Microsoft Theatre where they performed last year at ACT: LOVESICK.</p>
  <h2>Setlist Review</h2>
<p>The setlist started with Blue Hour (Dance Break ver.). When I found out, I was really excited because the year before at ACT: LOVESICK, they performed Blue Hour, but they didn't perform the Dance Break Version. I feel like the ACT: LOVESICK setlist was better than this setlist, but that one was hard to beat. I still loved the setlist this year. Most of the songs were not performed at their previous concert, but title tracks and some b-sides such as "Opening Sequence", "Anti-Romantic", and "Eternally". This year, I was really excited to see "Eternally" again because that was one of the performances that I rewatched a lot after ACT: LOVESICK. With the release of their new album in January, they included all of the songs from the album in the setlist. I loved all of these songs and their performances. I was really happy with the setlist for the tour. </p>

  <h2>Performance Review</h2>
<p>I think that TXT did such a great job that night. Even though they didn't have any backup dancers, they were able to carry the stage by themselves. Throughout the night, their singing and dancing stayed consistent despite the concert being over 3 hours long. The use of confetti and fireworks added an extra boost of joy to the performances. </p>
<h2>Favorite Performances</h2>
<p> My favorite performance of the night was "Farewell Neverland". It was also the performance that I was most excited to see. It's my favorite song from their new album, and it's one of if not my favorite b-side from their whole discography. The performance started with them singing the opening verse on a ship prop before dispersing across the main stage. Then, they walked down the stage to the extended stage before dancing to the melody of the song. The whole time I was watching this I was in awe. I watched this performance so many times online, and it was crazy for me to finally see it in person. I tried extra hard to make sure that my camera was steady, and I made sure to not sing along and just absorb the performance. </p>
<h2>Venue+Seat Review</h2>
<p>BMO Stadium is a venue that holds up to 22,000 people. You do have to pay for the parking, so I was just dropped off with my friend. There are a good amount of food options at the venue. The stage is also pretty big, with really big screens. I sat in section B3, row 9, seat 5. This was the second section from the stage in the middle of the floor. In front of me there were about 6/7 seats rows in the first section closest to the stage, a gap between the two sections, then the start of my section. Initially, I was scared my seat would be too far away, and people would be too tall for me to see. However, my seat ended up being more than what I expected and they were really close to the stage. However, I was also wearing really tall shoes that let me tower over the people in front of me, but that was at the cost of my feet burning and being really sore.  </p>
<h2>Final Review</h2>
<p>ACT: SWEET MIRAGE Day 1 in LA was the best concert I've ever attended. I rate it a ∞/10.</p>
