<p>I attended DAY 1 of ACT: SWEET MIRAGE in LA on May 27, 2023.</p>
  <h2>Setlist Review</h2>
<p>I rate the setlist a 9.7/10. It completed most of my list of songs that I wanted to see them perform live, but there were some songs that I wished I was able to see them perform. </p>

  <h2>Performance Review</h2>
<p>I think that TXT did such a great job that night. Throughout the night, their singing and dancing stayed consistent despite the concert being over 3 hours long. I loved seeing the confetti and fireworks in the sky. </p>

<h2>Favorite Performances</h2>
<p> My favorite performance of the night was "Farewell Neverland". It was also the performance that I was most excited to see since it is my favorite song from the album. I watched this performance so many times online,so it was crazy to finally see it in person. </p>

<h2>Venue+Seat Review</h2>
<p>BMO Stadium has a 22,000-person capacity and has a pretty big stage, with really big screens. I sat in section B3, row 9, seat 5 which was the second section from the stage in the middle of the floor. There were about 6/7 seats rows in the first section closest to the stage, a gap between the two sections, then the start of my section. A lot of people say floor isn't worth it if it isn't in the first 5 rows, but I had a pretty good view, granted I was wearing really tall shoes. </p>

<h2>Final Review</h2>
<p>ACT: SWEET MIRAGE Day 1 in LA was the best concert I've ever attended. I rate it a ∞/10.</p>
