  <h2>ACT: SWEET MIRAGE</h2>
  <p>ACT: SWEET MIRAGE is Tomorrow X Together's Second World Tour centering around their latest album <em>The Name Chapter: Temptation</em>. The group performed 25 songs including an unreleased song, <em>Blue Spring</em>. I attended DAY 1 of ACT: SWEET MIRAGE in LA on May 27, 2023. </p>
  <h2>Getting the Tickets</h2>
  <p></p>The tour was announced in INSERT MONTH, but ticket sale dates weren't released until INSERT MONTH. However, the tickets would be for sale during school hours when I was in athetics. There was no way that I was going to be able to take out my laptop during atheltics to get my tickets. So, I asked my friend Meera, a seasoned ticketsale soldier, to get my tickets for me. </p>
  <h2>Starting the Day<h2>
    <p>I started the day off packing my stuff to go to my friend Charlotte's house. I got to her house around 10:30 that day to get ready. We caught up and started getting ready for the day ahead of us. </p>
  <h2>Setlist Review</h2>
The setlist started with Blue Hour (Dance Break ver.) which excited fans including me when it was released. The previous year at ACT: LOVESICK, they only performed Blue Hour without the Dance Break. I think starting the night with Blue Hour was a great choice on the team's part as the sky was still blue when it started.
